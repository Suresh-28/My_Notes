There are two ways to do angular bootstrap project
Now come back to Vscode

.....Way-1.......

>Goto style.css and paste the code ( copied from main.css)
>Next open component.app.html 
>Remove the existing code and paste the code ( copied from body to fo0ter).
 Now time to create components( create as per the view frame source code suggests)
>To create a component > ng g c <component name>
> After creating component 
> Cut the code from the app.component.html and paste in the app.<component name>.htm (cut and paste ony one frame ).
> Do this same for remaining components
 And next most important thing is to copy the header files and script files from source.
>Paste it in the index.html ( scripts in body and styles in head)
And goto bootstrap documentation on googe and copy the head and script code. Paste it in the index.html file.
Now run the localhost > ng serve
